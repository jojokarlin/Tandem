DAME TROT AND HER
CAT

Dame Trot and her cat
Led a peaceable life, 
When they were not troubled 
With other folks’ strife. I

When Dame had her dinner
, Pussy would wait,

And was sure to receive

A nice piece from her plate.

THREE CHILDREN ON
THE ICE

Three children sliding on the ice
Upon a summer’s day,

As it fell out, they all fell in,
The rest they ran away.

‘Oh, had these children been at

THE OLD WOMAN UNDER
A HILL

There was an old woman

SChO_Ol_’ - Lived under a hill;
Or sliding on dry ground, And if Shevs not gone,
Ten thousand pounds to one penny She lives there Still.
They had not then been drowned.
Ye parents who have children dear, TWEEDLE‘DUM AND
And ye, too, who have none, TWEEDLE'DEE
If you would keep them safe abroad Tweedledum and Tweedledee
Pray keep them Safe at home‘ Resolved to have a battle
For Tweedle-dum said Tweedle-dee
CROSS PATCH Had spoiled his nice new rattle.
' Cross patch, draw the latch, Just then flew by a monstrous crow,
Sit by the ﬁre and spin; As big as a tar barrel, _ ,
Take a cup and drink it up, Which frightened both the heroes so,

Then call your neighbors in. They quite foggot their quarrel.
