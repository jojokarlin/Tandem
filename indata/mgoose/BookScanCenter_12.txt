A MELANCHOLY SONG

‘ Trip upon trenchers,
 And dance upon dishes,

My mother sent me for some barm,
some barm;

ll She bid me go lightly,

A And come again quickly,

 - For fear the young men should do
‘me, some harm.

Yet did n’t you see, yet did n’t you
see,

What naughty tricks they put upon

They broke my

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
    

pitcher
And spilt the
water, I

And huffed my
mothe1¥\\_
And chid her

daughter,
And kissed my

‘ sister instead

of me.

Jack be nimble, Jack be
quick,
Jack jump over the candle-

GOING TO ST. IVES

As I was going to St. Ives

I met a man with seven wives.
Every wife had seven sacks,
Every sack had seven cats,
Every cat had seven kits.

Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,

How many were going to St. Ives?
