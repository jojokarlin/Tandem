IF WISHES WERE HORSES

If wishes were horses, beggars would
ride.

If turnips were watches, I would
wear one by my side.

And if “ifs” and “ands"
Were pots and pans,

There’d be no Work for tinkers!

TO MARKET

To market, to market, to buy a fat
Pig.

Home again, home again, jiggety jig.

To market, to market, to buy a fat
hog,

Home again, home again, jiggety
jog. ‘

To market, to market, to buy a plum
bun,

Home again, home again, market is
done.

 

OLD CHAIRS TO MEND

If I'd as muchimoney as I could

spend,

I never would cry old chairs to
mend;

Old chairs to mend, old chairs to
mend;

I never would cry old chairs to mend;

If I’d as much money as I could
tell,

I never would cryiold clothes to
sell;

Old clothes to sell, old clothes to
sell;

I never would cry old clothes to sell.
