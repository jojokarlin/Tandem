THE CLOCK

There 's a neat little clock,—

In the schoolroom it stands,—
And it points to the time

With its two little hands.

And may we, like the clock,

Keep a face clean and bright,
With hands ever ready
To do what is right.

WINTER

Cold and raw the north wind
cloth blow,
Bleak in the morning early;

All the hills are covered with

snow,

And winter 's now come fairly.

FINGERS AND TOES
Every lady in this land

Has twenty nails, upon each
hand

Five, and twenty on hands and
feet:

All this is true, without deceit.

A SEASONABLE SONG

Piping hot, smoking hot.
What I've got
You have not.

Hot gray pease, hot, hot, hot;

Hot gray pease, hot.
