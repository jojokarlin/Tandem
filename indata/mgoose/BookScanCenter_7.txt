THE REAL

  MOTHER GOOSE

LITTLE BO-PEEP

Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep,

And can’t tell where to ﬁnd
them;

Leave them alone, and they'll come
home,

And bring their tails behind
them. ‘

Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep,
And dreamt she heard them
bleating; I
But wigen she awoke, she found it
a joke,
“or still they all were fleeting.

Then up she took her little crook,
Determined forﬁo ﬁnd them;
Site found them indeed, but it made
her heart, bleed,
For they'd ‘left all their tails
behind 'e1nl

It happened one day, as Bo—peep
didstray
Unto a meadow hard by—

There she espied their tails, side
by side, ‘ ‘
All hung on a tree to dry.

 
  
    
 
  
  
  

She heaved a sigh and wipedher eye, I
And ‘over the hillocks she
raced;
And tried what she could, as a
shepherdess should,
That each tail should be prop-
erly placed.

LITTLE BOY BLUE

Little Boy Blue, come, blow your
horn!

The sheep's in the meadow, the
cows in the corn.

Where's the little boy that looks
after the sheep?

Under the haystack, fastasleep!

RAIN

Rain, ra-in, _go away,
Come again another day;
Little’ Johnny wants to play.
