# Tandem
DH Project to analyze text and images in one interface

PYTHON SETUP
Mac's come with Python. I would suggest you work with that version unless issues arise.

XCOCDE
It's recommended by lots of sites to install XCode. It's unclear to me at the moment what
XCode gives you, but it's an easy install. Here is the link:

NLTK SET UP
For help outside of these notes go to http://nltk.org

First launch terminal which is your command line interface.
These steps are all commands you type at the command line prompt except for
the first which a hyperlink. You type the text after the word run in each line.
Install Setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
Install Pip: run sudo easy_install pip
Install Numpy: run sudo pip install -U numpy
Install NLTK: run sudo pip install -U nltk


Now Test to see if your installation worked:
run python then type import nltk
Success will be if no errors are displayed after the import command.
